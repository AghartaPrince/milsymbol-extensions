# milsymbol extensions
This is a collection of various extensions to milsymbol that are created for different purposes. They are provided as is and may not work with future versions of milsymbol, they are not updated when the milsymbol API is changed, but instead of just having them laying around I thought I put them here and someone might find them useful.

## Requirements
- milsymbol.js

## License
Same as milsymbol, see license.txt.
